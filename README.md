# ðŸŒ¿ Planthurium
Planthuriums for anthurium enthusiasts and collectors! Explore our marketplace to buy, sell, or trade anthurium pollen and seedlings, connecting passionate growers worldwide!

## About the project
There are a lot of online BST markets for houseplants, but not a lot for anthuriums. Anthurium pollen and seedlings are popular items to swap in the community. I saw that my plant community used Google Sheets as a database to collect info about anthurium pollen and wanted to transform that into a fully functional website.
